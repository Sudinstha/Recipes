    <h2>Recipe Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine yeast, a few teaspoons of warm water, and the sugar in a small bowl, Set a side for 10 minutes, or until the mixture is frothy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk together flour and salt.
        </li>  
        <li>
            Add oil, herbs, and asafetida to the frothy yeast mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture.
            Add three-quarters of the warm water and mix. Add enough of the remaining
            for 5 minutes or until smooth.
            water, if required, to make a soft but nonsticky dough. Knead the dough
        </li>

        <li>
             Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and leave in
            a warm place for one hour or until doubled in size.
        </li>

        <li>
            Punch down the dough and divide into 18 even-sized pieces. Shape them by
            rolling them around under cupped hands on a floured board or marble slab,
            then arrange them fairly close together in a lightly oiled 25-cm
            (10-inch) quiche pan or round, shallow baking dish. Keep in mind that
            the rolls will approximately double in size.
        </li>

        <li>
            Allow the rolls to rise again for about 30 minutes. Spray with water and
            sprinkle with poppy seeds, sesame, fine oatmeal, or dried herbs.
        </li>

        <li>  
            Preheat the oven to 220°C / 430°F and bake the rolls for 30–35 minutes
            or until golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped on the underside.
            Serve.
