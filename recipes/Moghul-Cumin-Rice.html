    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>2&frac14; cups water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ghee or oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>6 whole cloves</li>
        <li>one 5-cm cinnamon stick</li>

        <li>1&frac12; cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lightly cooked fresh peas or thawed frozen peas</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring to a boil the water and salt in a small saucepan over moderate heat. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and reduce the heat to low.</li>
        <li>Heat the ghee or oil in a larger saucepan over moderate heat. Add the cumin seeds, cloves, and cinnamon stick and toast until the cumin darkens a few shades. Add the ginger, stir-fry until aromatic, then sprinkle in the asafetida, cumin powder, raisins, and rice. Stir the rice for 1-2 minutes or until it turns translucent.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water, raise the heat, and quickly bring the rice to a full boil. Stir briefly, then reduce the heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and gently simmer without stirring for about 20 minutes or until the grains are tender</li>
        <li>Lift the lid, drops in the peas,and quickly replace the lid. Remove the rice from the heat and set it aside for 5 minutes to allow the rice grains to firm up. Before serving, remove the cinnamon stick and gently fold in the peas. Serve piping hot.</li>
